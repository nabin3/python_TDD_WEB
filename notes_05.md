Always commit before refactoring.

# Debugging functional tests:
When a functional test fails with an unexpected failure, there are several
things we can do to debug it:
* Add print statements, to show, for example, what the current page text is.
* Improve the error message to show more info about the current state.
* Manually visit the site yourself.
* Use time.sleep to pause the test during execution so you can inspect what was happening.3

# CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) token:
Djangoâ€™s CSRF protection involves placing a little auto-generated unique token into each generated form, to be able to verify that POST requests have definitely come from the form generated by the server. To add the CSRF token we use a template tag, which has the curly-bracket/percent syntax, {% ... %}
Django will substitute the template tag during rendering with an 
<input type="hidden"> containing the CSRF token.

# Passing python variables to be rendered in the templates:
The notion is {{ ... }}, which displays the object as a string.
