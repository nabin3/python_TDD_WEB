Always commit before refactoring.

# Debugging functional tests:
When a functional test fails with an unexpected failure, there are several
things we can do to debug it:
* Add print statements, to show, for example, what the current page text is.
* Improve the error message to show more info about the current state.
* Manually visit the site yourself.
* Use time.sleep to pause the test during execution so you can inspect what was happening.3

# CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) token:
Django’s CSRF protection involves placing a little auto-generated unique token into each generated form, to be able to verify that POST requests have definitely come from the form generated by the server. To add the CSRF token we use a template tag, which has the curly-bracket/percent syntax, {% ... %}
Django will substitute the template tag during rendering with an 
<input type="hidden"> containing the CSRF token.

# Passing python variables to be rendered in the templates:
The notion is {{ ... }}, which displays the object as a string.

# Django ORM:
An Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) is a layer of abstraction for data stored in a database with tables, rows, and columns. It lets us work with databases using familiar object-oriented metaphors which work well with code. Classes map to database tables, attributes map to columns, and an individual instance of the class represents a row of data in the database.
    In Django, the ORM’s job is to model and read and write from database tables, but there’s a second system that’s in charge,of actually creating the tables in the database called “migrations”. Its job is to let you to add, remove, and modify tables and columns,based on changes you make to your models.py files

* To build first database migration we run ```python manage.py makemigrations```
* Classes that inherit from models.Model map to tables in the database. By default they get an auto-generated id attribute, which will be a primary key column in the database, but you have to define any other columns and attributes you want explicitly.
Example of defining fields
```bash
class Item(models.Model):
    text = models.TextField()   # There is also Integer, Char and DateField and so on
```
* When ever we add a new field we need to run ```python manage.py makemigrations```. Running this will gives us option to choose default values for existing rows.

# Django template for iteration:
```bash
{% for ... in ... %}
    ...
{% endfor %}
```
